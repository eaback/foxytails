                        <h2>Why We Do What We Do</h2>
                        <p>Recent studies have shown a concerning trend in children's reading habits. According to a report by the National Literacy Trust, there has been a significant fall in children reading for pleasure. At Foxy Tails, we're committed to reversing this trend by creating a love for reading from an early age.</p>
